          Note that there are drop zones on the 3rd and the 7th hole. If the ball ends up in the lakes or bogs must, with 1 penalty stroke, dropped on the mats. Putte Putting Green (PG) is out of bounds and the ball lands there, turn a new battle. There are also out of bounds along the boundaries of the 5th and 6th hole, it is marked with white stakes or white lines.
