          <p>Senior Club is a very social and cozy "club in the club." It's an incredibly active club where everyone quickly get to know each other. The jokes and the tone is very unpretentious. In recent years there have been between 75 and 100 participants in every match.
          <br /><br />
          To participate in senior matches must have bagmærke and be aged 50 before the end of 2016 .... 
          If a participant meets the criterion of age, you spouse / partner participate REGARDLESS OF AGE.
          <br /><br /> 
          We play every Monday and you can play at any time of the day, however Senior club has reserved time between the hours. 15:00 and 17:00. If you want to use these reserved tee times, ask the Secretariat to register as a member of Senior's matches and you can book times via Golfbox.
          <br /><br /> 
          The matches played as Stableford over 10 holes (Hole 1 to 10). If you want to, you can of course play 18 holes, but it is the score on the first 10 who is counting. It is played in two series: A-series is handicap 0 to 22.0 and B-row 22.1 and above. There is no upper limit. All with bagmærke can participate!
          <br /><br /> 
          The matches starts on the first Monday in April, if the pitch is ready, and then played every Monday throughout the season excluding holidays (eg. Easter and Pentecost). The first Monday of the month are super cozy meals together with Prizes for the previous month's match. Ending dinner is the first Monday in October, when we tradition treats roast pork and rice á la mande with associated almond gifts.
